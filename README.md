# Projet-Python-Anthony-Theo-Dorian


Project Overview

This project analyzes bike rental patterns in Seoul to understand the factors influencing bike usage. The goal is to derive insights that can contribute to better urban planning and sustainable transportation solutions.


Data Processing and Analysis

Initial Data Handling

- The dataset, `SeoulBikeData.csv`, contains detailed records of daily bike rentals along with environmental and temporal data.
- We focused on cleaning the data by removing duplicates and handling missing values, ensuring a robust dataset for analysis.

  
Descriptive Analysis

- Preliminary analysis included statistical descriptions to understand the data's general characteristics and distributions.

  
Visualization Techniques

Visualizations were a key component of our analysis:
- Time series graphs to illustrate bike rental trends over various time periods.
- Correlation plots to examine relationships between different variables, such as weather conditions and rental numbers.

  
Predictive Modeling

Model Selection

- We experimented with several predictive models. After some trials, the Random Forest model was chosen for its effectiveness in our context.

  
Performance Evaluation

- The Random Forest model demonstrated high accuracy with an R² score of 0.9, indicating its strong predictive capabilities.
- It also showed the lowest Mean Squared Error, highlighting its reliability in predictions.

  
HTML Interface

- To enhance the accessibility of our findings, we developed an HTML interface. This interactive component allows for an intuitive exploration of the data and models.

  
Challenges and Learnings

- Model optimization, especially using techniques like grid search, posed significant computational challenges, providing us with practical insights into the complexities of data science projects.
